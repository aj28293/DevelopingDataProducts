The purpose of this application is to explore the Swiss dataset available in R by selecting data(swiss). The Swiss dataset includes standardized fertility measure and socio-economic indicators for each of 47 French-speaking provinces of Switzerland at about 1888.

The application performs a basic plotting of Fertility and Socioeconomic indicators vs. Infant Mortality rates.

**Details**

(paraphrasing Mosteller and Tukey):

Switzerland, in 1888, was entering a period known as the demographic transition; i.e., its fertility was beginning to fall from the high level typical of underdeveloped countries.

The data collected are for 47 French-speaking "provinces" at about 1888.

Here, all variables are scaled to [0, 100], where in the original, all but "Catholic" were scaled to [0, 1].
